# BOT COMMANDS DOCUMENTATION


# 1.Document Description & Instructions

This document contains information regarding all the commands users can run with the bot.
This includes information regarding the commands' names, arguments and what they specifically do.
These descriptions will be very surface level and it's advised that one read the modules text file
to fully understand the command descriptions.

To run the commands, simply type "$" followed by the command's name
For example, to run the "pokelist" command, type "$pokelist".
 
If a command requires arguments, simply type them after the command name, each separated by a space.
For example, to run the "createprofile" command, type "$createprofile [name] [file]"
