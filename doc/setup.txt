# SETUP DOCUMENTATION


# 1. Document Description

This document will show how users can run the Poke Bot on their own Discord servers. It's important
to mention that at the moment, there is no setup.py, which means this document will show users how
to create their own virtual environment to run the program. This will be concerned with OSX and
Windows, since it's assumed most Linux users are very resourceful and most likely will already
understand the concepts in this document.

WARNING: Odds are there will be some issues when following these instructions. Everyone's computers
handle python differently and some things may need to be switched around. You may need to refer to
"python" or "python3" and "pip" or "pip3". Things should fall into place with some google'ing.

# 2. Prerequisites

To run this program, a user must have Python version 3.7+ to run the program. This is crucial because
the bot was written with the discord.py rewrite. Users must also have pip (provided with Python
3.7+) and virtualenv. 


# 3. Installing Python

Python Link: https://www.python.org/

Installing Python is very straightforward process. For Windows and OSX, simply go to the downloads
section and select a download for your operating system. It's important to make sure the version is
at least Python 3.7!

If you already have Python installed on your machine, you can check its version with the following
commands.

OSX Terminal: "$ python -v" or "$ python3 -v"
Windows Command Line: Run "python" or "python3" and check the version number when in the interactive
console. Run "quit()" to exit.


# 4. Install Pip

Pip comes included with all Python 3.7+ versions. If I'm mistaken, please let me know on GitHub so
I can provide more extensive documentation. You may also need to use pip3 if python 3.7+ is 
associated with the command "python3".


# 5. Install Virtualenv

This will be the trickiest part of the installation (but not difficult). First, upgrade pip with
one of the following commands:

OSX Terminal: "$ pip install --upgrade pip" or "pip3 install --upgrade pip"
Windows Command Line: "python -m pip install --upgrade pip" or "python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip"

After upgrading pip, you can install virtualenv with the following commands:

OSX Terminal: "$ pip install virtualenv" or "$ pip3 install virtualenv"
Windows Command Line: "python -m pip install virtualenv" or "python3 -m pip install virtualenv"


# 6. Creating the virtual environment

Once you have everything installed, you can create your virtual environment with these steps:

OSX & Linux
1. Open your terminal and cd to the folder where you stored the downloaded files.
2. Run "$ python3 -m virtualenv ." or "$ python -m virtualenv ."
3. Run "$ source bin/activate"
4. Run "$ pip install -r requirements.txt"
5. Run "$ deactivate"

WINDOWS
1. Open your command line and cd to the folder where you stored the downloaded files.
2. Run "py -m virutalenv ."
3. Run "Scripts\activate"
4. Run "python -m pip install -r requirements.txt"
5. Run "deactivate"

WARNING: There may be an error trying to install Discord.py when running the requirements.txt. Try
one of the following commands with a pip install to fix the issue (ex. "pip install -U ..."):

"-U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite#egg=discord.py[voice]"
"-U https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/archive/rewrite.zip#egg=discord.py[voice]"


# 7. Registering the bot with your Discord server

This is somewhat extensive, so I'll be providing a link for reference. When you get to the part
where you find your bot's token, find the TOKEN variable at the top of the PokeBot.py file and
replace it with your bot's token (ex. "TOKEN = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'").

# 8. Running the bot

The worst is over, now you can run your bot! To do this, simply follow steps 1 and 3 in section
6, then go through the following instructions:

INSTRUCTIONS
1. cd into the pokebot folder
2. Run "python PokeBot.py" or "python3 PokeBot.py"

Now that you have your bot running and working, view the commands documentation to utilize all of
PokeBot's useful features!
