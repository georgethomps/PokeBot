# MODULES DOCUMENTATION


# 1. Document Description

This document describes the role of the program's modules and how they can be utilized by the
program's users.


# 2. Data Manager (DataManager package)

The Data Manager is responsible for managing all user profile settings and retrieving comments for
the bot to display to users. This data is managed through the files in the "users" and "comments"
folders


DATA MANAGER FILES & FOLDERS

FILE "user_data.txt" ("users" folder)
DESCRIPTION: This file allows the Data Manager to view the names of the users that may be mentioned
in Discord as well as what text files are associated with each user. Each user is associated with
one text file that contains all of the comments that the bot may select to send to a particular user.

WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THIS FILE! ONLY MODIFY THE PROFILE SETTINGS THROUGH DISCORD!

FOLDER "comments"
DESCRIPTION: This folder contains all of the text files that are linked in the "user_data.txt".
Each comment must solely be written on one individual line. This can be done with programs such as
NotePad or TextEdit (if this is not done, the bot will return incomplete comments).
These files should be marked with the extention ".txt".  


# 3. Poke List

The Poke List is simply responsible for managing which users should be provided comments by the bot
when a user is mentioned in Discord. For example, you may have profile settings for both users
George and Noah, but you may only want the bot to provide comments when only Noah is mentioned.

To specify which users should be targeted by the bot, you can simply load them or unload them from
the Poke List (view the commands documentation for more).


# 4. Poke Bot

The Poke Bot is the bot that sends comments to the Discord server. Users can run commands with the
bot to utilize the function of the Data Manager and Poke List (see the commands documentation for
more).
